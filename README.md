# Qt-Based Projects

This repository contains three projects that showcase the use of **Qt** programming with **C++**, integrating functionalities such as SQL database management, file handling, data processing, and more.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Application 1 **Multi-Operation Calculator** 
This is an advanced calculator that handles multiple operations and adheres to the mathematical order of operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS). It can solve complex expressions, including those with brackets, and provides floating-point precision. Highlights include:
- Support for multiple operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
- Bracket handling for complex calculations
- Floating-point precision
- Input validation and error handling

### 2. Application 2 **Attendance Recording Software** 
An attendance management system that allows the user to create and manage class data. The application interacts with SQL databases for class and student management, and it enables the user to record attendance, edit data, and export tables to CSV. Key functionalities include:
- Class creation, deletion, and renaming
- Student data import via CSV files
- Attendance tracking with date and time labels
- Search, edit, and export options using SQL databases

### 3. Application 3 **English Writing Test Program** 
This application is designed as an exam tool for testing English writing skills. It allows users to input a set number of words and a time limit, then takes the user to a full-screen writing environment. The program records the writing and saves the results as encoded files to ensure integrity. Features include:
- Full-screen test mode
- Automatic word count and time tracking
- File encoding using **Base64** and Chinese characters
- Decoding for examiners to review the results

## Concepts Used
- **Qt Framework**: For building cross-platform GUI applications in C++.
- **C++**: Core programming language used to implement logic and functionality.
- **SQL**: Database interaction for data management (attendance recording).
- **File Handling**: Reading and writing CSV files, saving and encoding exam results.
- **Data Management**: Managing class/student data and attendance records.
- **Text Processing**: Encoding and decoding of writing exam files (text files) using Base64 to ensure integrity.

These projects demonstrate the integration of various tools and concepts within **Qt** and **C++**, emphasizing real-world applications in education and data management.
