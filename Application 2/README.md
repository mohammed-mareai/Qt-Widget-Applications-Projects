This application is attendance recording software. This software is used to record the attendance of students from different classes. 
This application provides the following functionality:
1. Allow the user to insert a new class (table) in which it can insert students and their attendance. The user can also delete/rename the classes as well. 
2. For each class (table), the student names can be inserted manually, or the user can import them from a CSV file. The CSV file should have "Name" as the first column.
3. The user can add or remove students after adding them. 
4. For the same class, the user can add all students' attendance on a specific day and time. This is done through a second UI to take the input. This attendance will be recorded in a new column with a column name indicating the date and time of the attendance. 
5. The user can remove a day (attendance column).
6. The user can select a class using a combo box and the class will be shown in a table view.
7. The user can edit the data inside the database directly from the table view using a Radio Button to allow editing.
8. The user can search for a name inside a class. 

The application has most functions to interact with SQL databases using QT.
