## Multi-Operation Calculator

This application is an advanced calculator capable of solving multiple mathematical operations at once. It follows the correct order of operations, also known as **BODMAS/PEMDAS** (Brackets, Orders (Exponents), Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction).

### Features:

1. **Multiple Operations**:
   - The calculator can handle multiple operations in a single input expression. 
   - It respects the mathematical order of operations: multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction, ensuring accurate results.

2. **Bracket Handling**:
   - The calculator can process expressions with brackets, evaluating the contents of parentheses first.
   - Nested brackets are also supported, allowing for complex calculations.

3. **Input Example**:
   - For an input like `"5 + 3 * (2 + 6) - 7 / 3"`, the calculator will first evaluate the expression inside the parentheses (`2 + 6`), followed by multiplication and division, and finally addition and subtraction.
   - The result of the above operation will be: `26.6667`.

4. **Floating-Point Precision**:
   - The calculator supports floating-point numbers and will return results with decimal precision.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The application can detect and report invalid inputs or malformed expressions, ensuring that the user is alerted in case of an error (such as dividing by zero or incorrect syntax).

6. **User-Friendly Interface**:
   - The calculator provides a simple and intuitive user interface for inputting expressions and receiving results, making it suitable for a wide range of users.

This calculator application is designed to provide accurate results while handling complex mathematical expressions in a seamless and efficient manner.
